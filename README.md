Data Files for HIV-1 Manuscript titled "HIV-1 Drug Resistance and Genetic Diversity in a Cohort of people living with HIV-1 in Nigeria"

This repository contains template consensus sequences (TCSs), individual representative sequences and results of mapping to the HIV-1 reference genome (HXB2).

A custom bash script used for extracting representative sequences from TCSs is also provided:

**How to run the bash script:**

In your terminal:

Go to the directory where you save this script. (using cd command)

cd [path_to_script]

**Run the script to randomly pick a certain number of sequences. change [path_to_your_fasta_sequence] andÂ [number_of_sequence_to_pick]**

random_pick_sequence [path_to_your_fasta_sequence] [number_of_sequence_to_pick]
